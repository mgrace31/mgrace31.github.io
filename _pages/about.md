As a first-year PhD student in Computer Science, I bring a robust foundation in both Computer Science and Linguistics, with a keen focus on their intersection. My research projects have centered on student-AI teaming and offensive language error analysis, demonstrating my proficiency in addressing complex language-related challenges. With a dedicated focus on creating reliable, explainable, and safe AI models, I am committed to using Natural Language Processing for human-centered applications.
